# Project: ContextKeeper v3
# Purpose: Emergency project restructure script
# Dependencies: System utilities, project files
# Dependents: Emergency recovery workflow
# Created: 2025-08-05 (moved from root)
# Modified: 2025-08-05
#
# PLANNING CONTEXT:
# Moved from root directory to scripts/ as part of governance cleanup.
# This appears to be an emergency restructure script - should be in scripts/
# as it's an operational utility, not documentation.
#
# TODO FROM PLANNING:
# - [ ] Verify script functionality after move
# - [ ] Document when/how to use this emergency script
# - [ ] Ensure it has proper safeguards

# === NAVIGATION ===
# Previous: [../] - root directory (emergency situations)
# Next: [./] - other utility scripts
# Parent: [../] - root contextkeeper directory

# Original file content should be preserved here
# This is a placeholder created during governance cleanup
