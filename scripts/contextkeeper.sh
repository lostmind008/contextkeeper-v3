# Purpose: Main contextkeeper CLI script
# Dependencies: rag_agent.py
# Dependents: CLI workflow, automation
# Created: 2025-08-05 (moved from root)

# PLANNING CONTEXT:
# Moved from root directory to scripts/ as part of governance cleanup.
# This appears to be the main contextkeeper CLI interface.
#
# TODO FROM PLANNING:
# - [ ] Verify script functionality after move
# - [ ] Update any hardcoded paths if necessary
# - [ ] Ensure this is the current version (vs contextkeeper_simple.sh)

# === NAVIGATION ===
# Previous: [../contextkeeper_manager.sh] - manager script
# Next: [./contextkeeper_simple.sh] - simplified version
# Parent: [../] - root contextkeeper directory

# Original file content should be preserved here
# This is a placeholder created during governance cleanup
