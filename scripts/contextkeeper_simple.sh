# Project: ContextKeeper v3
# Purpose: Simplified contextkeeper CLI script
# Dependencies: rag_agent.py
# Dependents: Simple CLI workflow
# Created: 2025-08-05 (moved from root)
# Modified: 2025-08-05
#
# PLANNING CONTEXT:
# Moved from root directory to scripts/ as part of governance cleanup.
# This appears to be a simplified version of the contextkeeper CLI.
#
# TODO FROM PLANNING:
# - [ ] Verify script functionality after move
# - [ ] Determine if this supersedes contextkeeper.sh or vice versa
# - [ ] Update any hardcoded paths if necessary

# === NAVIGATION ===
# Previous: [./contextkeeper.sh] - full version
# Next: [../rag_agent.py] - backend service
# Parent: [../] - root contextkeeper directory

# Original file content should be preserved here
# This is a placeholder created during governance cleanup
