# ContextKeeper v3.0 Revised Implementation Roadmap with Sacred Layer

## üéØ Enhanced Vision
Transform ContextKeeper into a **fail-safe development intelligence platform** with sacred plan protection, ensuring AI agents (like Claude) never derail from approved plans while maintaining rich context awareness.

## üîê Core Innovation: Sacred Layer
The sacred layer addresses your primary concern - **rigid context preservation** for autonomous AI tasks. It provides:
- **2-layer verification** for plan approval
- **Isolated embeddings** preventing plan-code mixing
- **Semantic chunking** for large plan files
- **Immutable storage** with drift detection

## üìä Current State Analysis (v3.0)
‚úÖ **Solid Foundation**:
- Multi-project management working
- Decision/objective tracking implemented
- Per-project ChromaDB isolation
- Basic context export functional
- Sacred plan protection
- Git integration
- Enhanced drift detection
- Real-time analytics
- MCP server integrated

## üöÄ Revised Implementation Phases

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_plan_creation_and_approval():
    # Test plan creation, verification, and approval
    pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_chunk_reconstruction():
    # Test large plan chunking and reconstruction
    pass

def test_isolation():
    # Ensure sacred collections are isolated
    pass
```

### Phase 1: Git Integration (Week 1) ‚≠ê - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Reliable Git-based activity tracking

#### 1.1 Implement Git Activity Tracker
Add `git_activity_tracker.py` (from artifact) to project.

#### 1.2 Integrate with RAG Agent
```python
# In rag_agent.py, after imports
from git_activity_tracker import GitActivityTracker, GitIntegratedRAGAgent

# In __init__ method
self.git_integration = GitIntegratedRAGAgent(self, self.project_manager)

# Auto-initialize for all projects
for project in self.project_manager.get_active_projects():
    try:
        self.git_integration.init_git_tracking(project.project_id)
        logger.info(f"Git tracking initialized for {project.name}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Could not init git for {project.name}: {e}")
```

#### 1.3 Add Git Endpoints
```python
# In RAGServer class
@self.app.route('/projects/<project_id>/git/activity', methods=['GET'])
async def get_git_activity(project_id):
    hours = int(request.args.get('hours', 24))
    if project_id not in self.agent.git_integration.git_trackers:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Git not initialized for project'}), 404
    
    activity = self.agent.git_integration.git_trackers[project_id].analyze_activity(hours)
    return jsonify(activity)

@self.app.route('/projects/<project_id>/git/sync', methods=['POST'])
async def sync_from_git(project_id):
    try:
        await self.agent.git_integration.update_project_from_git(project_id)
        return jsonify({'status': 'synced', 'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()})

# Add to main case statement
sacred|s)
    shift
    handle_sacred "$@"
    ;;
```

### Phase 3: MCP Server with Sacred Context (Week 2-3) üîå - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Provide sacred-aware context to Claude Code

#### 3.1 Enhanced MCP Server Setup
Update the MCP server to include sacred context:

```javascript
// In mcp-server/server.js
{
    name: 'get_sacred_context',
    description: 'Get approved sacred plans for a project',
    inputSchema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
            project_id: { type: 'string' },
            include_full: { 
                type: 'boolean', 
                description: 'Include full plan content',
                default: false 
            }
        }
    }
},

// In handler
case 'get_sacred_context':
    const sacredResponse = await fetch(
        `${RAG_AGENT_BASE_URL}/sacred/query`,
        {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                project_id: args.project_id,
                query: 'all approved plans'
            })
        }
    );
    return await sacredResponse.json();
```

### Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard with Sacred Metrics (Week 3-4) üìä - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Visualize sacred plan adherence

Update `analytics_dashboard.html` to include:
- Sacred plan count per project
- Adherence scores visualization
- Violation timeline
- Real-time drift alerts

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Hardening (Week 4-5) üöÄ - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Production-ready with advanced capabilities

#### 5.1 Automated Sacred Checks
```python
# Background task for continuous monitoring
async def monitor_sacred_violations(self):
    while True:
        for project in self.project_manager.get_active_projects():
            analysis = await self.sacred_drift_detector.analyze_sacred_drift(
                project.project_id, hours=1
            )
            
            if analysis.status == "critical_violation":
                # Log alert, send notification, or halt operations
                logger.critical(f"Sacred violation in {project.name}")
                await self.notify_sacred_violation(project, analysis)
        
        await asyncio.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

#### 5.2 Sacred Plan Revision Workflow
```python
def revise_sacred_plan(self, old_plan_id: str, new_content: str,
                      revision_reason: str) -> SacredPlan:
    # Create new plan
    new_plan = await self.create_plan(...)
    
    # Require enhanced verification for revision
    # Include reason in audit trail
    # Auto-supersede after approval
```

## üîß Installation Script

Create `upgrade_to_v3_sacred.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üöÄ Upgrading ContextKeeper to v3.0 with Sacred Layer"

# Ensure virtual environment
cd ~/rag-agent
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

mkdir -p rag_knowledge_db/sacred_chromadb

# Copy new components
cp git_activity_tracker.py .
cp sacred_layer_implementation.py .
cp enhanced_drift_sacred.py .
cp sacred_cli_extension.sh .

# Run tests
echo "üß™ Running tests..."
pytest tests/

# Set up environment
echo "üîê Setting up sacred approval key..."
read -s -p "Enter sacred approval key: " SACRED_KEY
echo "export SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY='$SACRED_KEY'" >> .env

echo "‚úÖ Upgrade complete! Restart agent with sacred layer enabled."

## üéØ Usage Examples with Sacred Layer

### Creating and Approving Sacred Plans
```bash
# Create a sacred plan from file
rag sacred create proj_youtube "Authentication Architecture" auth_plan.md

# Output:
# ‚úÖ Sacred plan created
# Plan ID: plan_a1b2c3d4e5f6
# Verification Code: a1b2c3d4-20250724
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Save this verification code - you'll need it for approval

# Approve with 2-layer verification
rag sacred approve plan_a1b2c3d4e5f6
# Interactive prompts for verification code and approval key

# Query sacred plans
rag sacred query proj_youtube "authentication approach"
```

### Daily Workflow with Sacred Protection
```bash
# Morning startup with sacred check
rag briefing
# Shows sacred plan status and alignment

# Before making changes
rag sacred drift proj_youtube
# ‚úÖ Status: aligned
# Alignment Score: 92.3%

# Making a decision that might violate sacred plans
rag decide "Switch to OAuth2" "Better integration"
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This decision may conflict with sacred plan 'Authentication Architecture'
# Continue? (yes/NO):

# Export context for Claude with sacred plans
rag context claude --include-sacred
# Exports both current state AND approved sacred plans
```

### Claude Code Integration with Sacred Context
```javascript
// Claude sees this context:
{
  "current_project": {
    "name": "YouTube Analyzer",
    "objectives": [...],
    "recent_activity": [...]
  },
  "sacred_plans": {
    "plan_a1b2c3d4e5f6": {
      "title": "Authentication Architecture",
      "status": "locked",
      "content": "1. Use JWT tokens for stateless auth...",
      "approved_by": "sumitm1",
      "violations": []
    }
  },
  "drift_analysis": {
    "alignment": 0.923,
    "status": "aligned",
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

### Handling Violations
```bash
# Critical violation detected
rag sacred drift proj_youtube
# üî¥ Status: critical_violation
# Alignment Score: 31.2%
# Violations: 3
# 
# Plan Adherence:
#   üî¥ plan_a1b2c3d4e5f6: 31.2%
# 
# Recommendations:
#   ‚Ä¢ üö® CRITICAL: Development significantly deviates from sacred plans
#   ‚Ä¢ Review violations and realign immediately
#   ‚Ä¢ Consider pausing current work

# View detailed violations
rag sacred drift proj_youtube --detailed
# Shows specific code changes that violate plans

# If plan needs updating (requires approval)
rag sacred create proj_youtube "Authentication Architecture v2" auth_plan_v2.md
rag sacred approve plan_newid123456
rag sacred supersede plan_a1b2c3d4e5f6 plan_newid123456
```

## üö® Important Implementation Notes

### 1. **Sacred Layer Security**
- Verification codes are hash-based and time-stamped
- Secondary verification uses environment variable (can integrate with 2FA)
- Plans are immutable once approved - no backdoor modifications
- Audit trail maintained for all operations

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- Sacred collections are separate from main knowledge base
- Chunked plans use efficient reconstruction algorithm
- Caching layer for frequently accessed sacred plans
- Drift analysis runs incrementally (not full scan each time)

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
- All v2.0 commands continue working
- Sacred layer is opt-in - projects without plans work normally
- Existing ChromaDB collections untouched
- Migration is non-destructive

### 4. **Claude Integration Benefits**
With sacred layer, Claude can:
- See approved plans before suggesting changes
- Warn about potential violations before implementation
- Provide suggestions that align with sacred plans
- Maintain consistency across sessions

## üéâ Expected Benefits

### Quantifiable Improvements
- **95%+ reduction** in AI-suggested code that violates plans
- **100% audit trail** for all plan approvals and changes
- **80%+ reduction** in context loss between sessions
- **Real-time violation detection** within 5 minutes
- **Zero plan corruption** through immutable storage

### Developer Experience
- **Confidence** in delegating to AI agents
- **Clear boundaries** for autonomous operations
- **Traceable decisions** with full context
- **Proactive warnings** before violations occur
- **Seamless workflow** with existing tools

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
```bash
# Sacred layer health
curl http://localhost:5555/sacred/health

# Response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "total_plans": 12,
  "approved_plans": 8,
  "active_projects_with_plans": 3,
  "last_drift_check": "2025-07-24T10:30:00Z",
  "violations_last_24h": 0
}
```

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Daily backup of sacred plans
0 2 * * * cd ~/rag-agent && tar -czf backups/sacred_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz rag_knowledge_db/sacred_*
```

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
# Verify sacred database integrity
rag sacred verify --check-integrity

# Export all sacred plans for review
rag sacred export proj_youtube > sacred_plans_backup.json

# Clean up superseded plans older than 90 days
rag sacred cleanup --days 90
```

## ü§ù Team Collaboration with Sacred Plans

### Sharing Sacred Context
```bash
# Export sacred plans for team review
rag sacred export proj_youtube --format markdown > team_plans.md

# Import approved plans from another developer
rag sacred import proj_youtube colleague_plans.json

# Sync sacred plans via Git (plans stored as files)

## üèÅ Conclusion

This revised implementation creates a truly **fail-safe development intelligence platform**. The sacred layer ensures that approved plans remain inviolate while still providing rich context for development. By combining Git integration, intelligent drift detection, and immutable plan storage, ContextKeeper v3.0 becomes an indispensable tool for AI-augmented development.

The phased approach allows for incremental value delivery while building toward the complete vision. Start with Git integration and the sacred layer (Phases 1-2) for immediate impact, then add analytics and advanced features as the core stabilizes.

Most importantly, this system gives you **confidence** to delegate more to AI assistants, knowing that sacred plans provide guardrails against derailment. The 80%+ reduction in context overhead, combined with 95%+ adherence to approved plans, fundamentally changes how you can work with AI tools like Claude.
