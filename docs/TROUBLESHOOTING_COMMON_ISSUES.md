# ContextKeeper v3.0 - Common Issues & Solutions

## ðŸš¨ Most Common Issues

### 1. "No project context specified" Error

**Problem**: When running queries, you get an error saying no project context is specified.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Follow this exact sequence:
1. Create project: ./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects create "name" /path
2. Focus project: ./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects focus <project_id>
3. Index files: python rag_agent.py ingest --path /path
4. Query: ./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "your question"
```

### 2. No Results from Queries

**Problem**: Queries return empty results even though project exists.

**Root Cause**: Files haven't been indexed after project creation.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Must index files after creating project
python rag_agent.py ingest --path /path/to/project

# This can take 2-3 minutes for large projects
# Check progress in logs: tail -f rag_agent.log
```

### 3. Wrong CLI Version

**Problem**: Commands don't work or show outdated help.

**Solution**:
- Use `rag_cli_v2.sh` NOT `rag_cli.sh`
- The v2 CLI has project management commands
- Update scripts: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`

### 4. Port Already in Use

**Problem**: Agent fails to start with "address already in use" error.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what's using port 5556
lsof -i :5556

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
python rag_agent.py server --port 5557
```

### 5. Indexing Timeout

**Problem**: Ingestion times out after 2 minutes.

**Solution**:
- This is normal for large projects
- The indexing continues in background
- Check completion in logs: `grep "Ingested" rag_agent.log`
- For very large projects, index in batches

### 6. Google API Errors

**Problem**: 403 errors or authentication failures.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env | grep GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Verify API key is valid
# Ensure Gemini API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
# Check quota limits haven't been exceeded
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Diagnostic Checklist

Run these commands to diagnose issues:

```bash
# 1. Check agent is running
curl http://localhost:5556/health

# 2. List projects
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects list

# 3. Check focused project
curl http://localhost:5556/projects | jq '.focused_project'

# 4. Test query endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query_llm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "test", "k": 5}'

# 5. Check logs for errors
tail -50 rag_agent.log | grep ERROR
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Issues

### Virtual Environment Not Active

**Symptoms**: Import errors, module not found

**Fix**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Permission Denied Errors

**Fix**:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
```

## ðŸ“ž Getting Help

If these solutions don't work:

1. Check the detailed logs: `tail -100 rag_agent.log`
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Verify your project path exists and contains files
5. Check GitHub issues for similar problems

## ðŸŽ¯ Prevention Tips

1. Always follow the create â†’ focus â†’ index â†’ query workflow
2. Wait for indexing to complete before querying
3. Use absolute paths for projects
4. Keep your API keys secure and valid
5. Monitor the rag_agent.log for issues
