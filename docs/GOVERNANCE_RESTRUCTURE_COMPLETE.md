# Governance Restructure Complete

**Date**: 2025-08-05 23:58 AEST  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

## Summary of Changes

Successfully completed full governance restructuring of ContextKeeper v3.0 project.

### 1. Python File Organization (48 files moved)
```
Before: 48 Python files scattered in root directory
After:  Organized into proper src/ structure

src/
├── core/         (2 files)  - Core system components
├── sacred/       (2 files)  - Sacred layer implementation  
├── analytics/    (1 file)   - Analytics integration
├── tracking/     (1 file)   - Git activity tracking
├── scripts/      (38 files) - Utility scripts and fixes
└── utils/        (0 files)  - Ready for future utilities
```

### 2. Test Organization (25 files moved)
- All test_*.py files moved to tests/
- All run_*.py test runners moved to tests/
- Maintains existing test subdirectories (sacred/, api/, integration/)

### 3. Governance Headers Added
Added comprehensive governance headers with embedded planning context to:
- `rag_agent.py` (already had header)
- `src/core/project_manager.py` 
- `src/sacred/sacred_layer_implementation.py`
- `src/sacred/enhanced_drift_sacred.py`
- `src/analytics/analytics_integration.py`
- `src/tracking/git_activity_tracker.py`

### 4. CLAUDE.md Files Created
Created context files for all new directories:
- `src/CLAUDE.md` - Overview of source structure
- `src/core/CLAUDE.md` - Core components context
- `src/sacred/CLAUDE.md` - Sacred layer context (updated existing)
- `src/analytics/CLAUDE.md` - Analytics context
- `src/tracking/CLAUDE.md` - Tracking context
- `src/scripts/CLAUDE.md` - Scripts context

### 5. Import Updates
- Updated `rag_agent.py` imports to use new src/ paths
- All imports now properly reference the new structure

### 6. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated PROJECT_MAP.md with complete new structure
- ✅ Updated LOGBOOK.md with governance completion entry
- ✅ Created this summary document

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Organization**: Code now organized by functional domain
2. **Reduced Root Clutter**: Only essential files remain in root
3. **Better Navigation**: Each directory has clear purpose and context
4. **Governance Compliance**: Full adherence to skeleton-first principles
5. **Maintainability**: Embedded planning context in all core files

## Next Steps

1. Create governance enforcement scripts
2. Add pre-commit hooks for compliance
3. Automate PROJECT_MAP.md generation
4. Test the new import structure thoroughly
