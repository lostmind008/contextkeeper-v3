## Why These Were Archived

These documents were moved to the archive because:

1. **Misleading Status**: They suggested the project was incomplete when it's actually operational
2. **Historical Value**: They provide important context about the development journey
3. **Clean Documentation**: Active documentation now accurately reflects current capabilities
4. **Development History**: They show the systematic approach taken to build v3.0

## For Developers

If you need to understand the development history or specific implementation decisions, these documents provide valuable context. However, for current usage and features, refer to the main documentation in the project root and `docs/` directory.
