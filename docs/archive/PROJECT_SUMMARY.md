# ContextKeeper v3.0 Sacred Layer - Implementation Summary
## 🎯 Project Overview
ContextKeeper v3.0 represents a major evolution from v2.0 multi-project RAG system to a Sacred Layer-protected development context awareness system. The Sacred Layer provides immutable architectural constraints with 2-layer verification to prevent AI agents from derailing from approved plans.
**Current Implementation Status**: Sacred Layer foundation 30% complete with comprehensive planning and documentation in place. Full implementation of 83 TODO items planned across 4 phases.
## 📋 Completed Features
### 1. **Multi-Project Support** ✅
- Dynamic project creation and management
- Independent ChromaDB collections per project
- Project-aware file watching and ingestion
- Automatic legacy project import
### 2. **Project Lifecycle Management** ✅
- Create, pause, resume, and archive projects
- Project focus switching
- State persistence across sessions
- Configuration stored in `~/.rag_projects/`
### 3. **Decision & Objective Tracking** ✅
- Record architectural decisions with reasoning
- Tag decisions for categorization
- Set project objectives with priorities
- Track objective completion status
- Full integration with vector search
### 4. **Context Export for AI Agents** ✅
- Export rich project context via API
- Include recent decisions and pending objectives
- Statistics and activity summaries
- Ready for MCP server integration
### 5. **Enhanced CLI Interface** ✅
- Comprehensive project management commands
- Intuitive shortcuts (p, d, o, c, b)
- Colorful output with icons
- Daily briefing functionality
- Backward compatible with v1.0
### 6. **REST API Extensions** ✅
- `/projects` endpoints for management
- `/objectives` endpoints for tracking
- `/context` endpoint for AI export
- Project-aware query filtering
## 🏗️ Architecture Changes
### Core Components
1. **project_manager.py** - New module for project lifecycle

4. **Per-project collections** - Isolated vector storage
### Key Design Decisions
- Separate collections per project for true isolation
- JSON-based project configuration for simplicity
- Backward compatibility through legacy import
- Focus-based default project selection
