# CLI Port Fix Test Plan

This is a test plan to validate that the CLI port fix is working correctly.

## Objective
Test that Sacred CLI can now connect to the server on port 5556 and receive actual responses instead of empty results.

## Expected Results
- Plan creation should return a valid plan ID
- Plan operations should work through CLI
- No more empty responses due to port mismatch

This plan validates the CLI port fix implementation.
