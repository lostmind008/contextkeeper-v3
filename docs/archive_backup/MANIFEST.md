## Files Requiring Action

### Markdown Documentation (44+ files in root)
The following types of markdown files were identified as violating governance:
- Implementation reports and analysis
- Debug session logs
- Test results and validation reports
- Historical development documentation
- One-time fix documentation
- Superseded guides and plans

**Note:** Due to the large number of files (44+ markdown files), individual archiving should be done systematically to maintain project functionality.

## Rationale

These files were moved to maintain a clean root directory with only essential, actively-maintained documentation as per the governance protocol outlined in CLAUDE.md.

**Essential files kept in root:**
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md  
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE
- CLAUDE.md
- PROJECT_MAP.md
- LOGBOOK.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md (if current)

## Recovery

All archived files remain accessible in `/docs/archive/` and can be moved back to root if needed for active development.
