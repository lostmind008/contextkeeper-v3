# Introducing RAG Knowledge Agent: My First Open-Source AI Project

## The Problem That Started It All

As a developer working on multiple projects, I constantly faced a frustrating problem: "What was that authentication system I implemented last month?" or "Where did I put that clever solution for handling rate limits?"

Traditional search tools weren't cutting it. They could find exact text matches, but they couldn't understand the *meaning* behind my code. I needed something smarter.

## Enter the RAG Knowledge Agent

That's why I built the RAG Knowledge Agent - an AI-powered assistant that:

- **Remembers everything**: It watches your project files and automatically indexes them
- **Understands context**: Using Google's Gemini embeddings, it searches semantically, not just by keywords
- **Tracks decisions**: Record why you chose Redis over MongoDB, and find that reasoning months later
- **Protects your secrets**: Automatically redacts API keys and sensitive data before indexing

## How It Works

The agent uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture:

1. **File Watching**: Monitors your project directories for changes
2. **Smart Chunking**: Breaks code into meaningful segments while preserving structure
3. **Vector Embeddings**: Converts code into high-dimensional vectors using Google's gemini-embedding-001
4. **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant code based on meaning, not just text matching

## Why Open Source?

This is my first AI agent, and I'm making it open source because:

- **Community makes everything better**: Your ideas and contributions can help this tool evolve
- **Learning together**: I've learned so much building this, and I want to share that journey
- **Building in public**: As I grow LostMindAI, transparency and community are core values

## What's Next?

I'm excited to see how the community uses and improves this tool. Some ideas on my roadmap:

- Support for more file types
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Multi-project knowledge graphs
- Team collaboration features

## Get Started

Check out the project on GitHub: [RAG Knowledge Agent](https://github.com/lostmind008/rag-knowledge-agent)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lostmind008/rag-knowledge-agent.git
cd rag-knowledge-agent
./setup.sh
```

## Join the Journey

This is just the beginning. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and contributions.

Let's build something amazing together!
