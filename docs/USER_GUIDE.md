## üéØ Sacred Layer (Architectural Governance)

The Sacred Layer provides architectural governance through immutable plans and drift detection.

### Core Concepts

**Sacred Plans** are architectural decisions that:
- Cannot be changed once approved (immutable)
- Require two-factor approval
- Are automatically monitored for drift
- Guide development decisions

### Creating Sacred Plans

1. **Write a plan file** (example: `auth_plan.md`):
```markdown
# Authentication Architecture

## Overview
OAuth2 + JWT implementation with Redis session storage.

## Components
- AuthService: Handles authentication logic
- TokenService: JWT token management
- UserRepository: User data persistence

## Constraints
- All passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
- Redis used for session management only
```

2. **Submit the plan**:
```bash
python contextkeeper_cli.py sacred create proj_123 "OAuth2 Authentication" auth_plan.md
```

3. **Approve the plan**:
```bash
# Get the plan ID from creation output, then:
python contextkeeper_cli.py sacred approve <plan_id>
# Enter verification code when prompted
# Enter SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY from your .env
```

### Monitoring and Drift Detection

```bash
# Check for architectural drift
python contextkeeper_cli.py sacred drift <project_id>

# Query sacred plans
python contextkeeper_cli.py sacred query <project_id> "How should authentication work?"

# List all sacred plans
python contextkeeper_cli.py sacred list <project_id>
```

### Sacred Plan Workflow

1. **Create** ‚Üí Write plan file and submit
2. **Review** ‚Üí Team reviews the architectural decision
3. **Approve** ‚Üí Two-factor approval makes it immutable
4. **Monitor** ‚Üí Automatic drift detection during development
5. **Query** ‚Üí Reference during development decisions

## üìä Analytics Dashboard

Access the dashboard at: `http://localhost:5556/dashboard`

## üîå API Quick Reference

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5556/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy"}
```

### Projects
```bash
# List all projects
curl http://localhost:5556/projects

# Create project
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Project","path":"/path/to/code"}'
```

### Queries
```bash
# Basic query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"How does auth work?","project_id":"proj_123"}'

# AI-enhanced query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"Explain auth","use_llm":true,"project_id":"proj_123"}'
```

### Sacred Plans
```bash
# Query sacred plans
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/sacred/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"authentication approach","project_id":"proj_123"}'

# Get sacred metrics
curl http://localhost:5556/sacred/metrics?project_id=proj_123
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port 5556 is in use
lsof -i :5556
# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Ensure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**No query results**
- Ensure you've indexed files: `python contextkeeper_cli.py ingest /your/project`
- Check project is focused: `python contextkeeper_cli.py projects list`
- Verify project path is correct in project creation

**Sacred plan approval fails**
- Check SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY in .env
- Ensure verification code is correct
- Verify plan file exists and is readable

**Dashboard not loading**
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server is running on port 5556
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Getting Logs

```bash
# Check server logs
python rag_agent.py server --debug

# Check CLI logs
python contextkeeper_cli.py --verbose <command>
```

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Verify everything is working
python contextkeeper_cli.py health
python contextkeeper_cli.py projects list
python contextkeeper_cli.py ask "test query"
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Project Organisation

- **Use descriptive project names**: "E-commerce API" not "proj1"
- **Focus on one project at a time** for better results
- **Update project indexes** after major code changes
- **Archive completed projects** to keep workspace clean

### Sacred Plans

- **Start with core architectural decisions** (auth, database, API design)
- **Keep plans focused and specific** (one concern per plan)
- **Review plans as a team** before approval
- **Monitor drift regularly** during development

### Query Optimization

- **Be specific in your questions**: "How does JWT validation work?" vs "How does auth work?"
- **Use tags and filters** when searching large codebases
- **Try both basic and AI-enhanced queries** for different insights
- **Use the chat interface** for iterative exploration

### Performance Tips

- **Exclude large files** (logs, builds, node_modules) during project creation
- **Update project indexes** instead of re-creating projects
- **Use project focus** to limit search scope
- **Monitor dashboard performance** on older devices
