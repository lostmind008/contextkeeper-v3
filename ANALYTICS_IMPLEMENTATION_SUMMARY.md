```

### Additional Endpoints

- `GET /analytics/sacred/project/<project_id>` - Detailed project analytics
- `POST /analytics/sacred/clear-cache` - Cache management

## üßÆ Metrics Calculated

### Overall System Metrics
- **Total Projects**: Count of all projects in system
- **Sacred Coverage**: Percentage of projects with sacred plans
- **Compliance Rate**: Percentage of approved vs total plans
- **Average Adherence Score**: Mean adherence score across projects

### Per-Project Metrics
- **Plan Count**: Total sacred plans for project
- **Approved Plans**: Count of approved plans
- **Adherence Score**: 0-100 score based on drift analysis
- **Drift Warnings**: Count of recent drift events
- **Status Breakdown**: Plans by status (DRAFT, APPROVED, LOCKED, SUPERSEDED)

### Drift Analysis
- **Total Drift Events**: System-wide drift event count
- **Projects with Drift**: Count of projects showing drift
- **Average Drift Severity**: Mean severity score
- **Recent Drift Events**: List of recent drift occurrences

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Calculation Logic
The `SacredMetricsCalculator` class provides:

1. **Overall Metrics Calculation**
   ```python
   async def calculate_overall_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
   ```

2. **Project-Specific Metrics**
   ```python
   async def calculate_project_metrics(self, project_filter: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
   ```

3. **Adherence Scoring Algorithm**
   ```python
   async def calculate_adherence_score(self, project_id: str) -> float
   ```
   - Starts with base score of 100
   - Deducts points for drift violations (max 50 points)
   - Deducts points for drift concerns (max 25 points)
   - Considers severity and frequency

### Service Layer Features
The `AnalyticsService` class provides:

1. **Caching**: 5-minute cache to avoid expensive recalculations
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback responses
3. **Async Operations**: Full async/await support
4. **Health Monitoring**: Component health checking

### Integration Points
- **Sacred Layer Manager**: Enhanced with statistics methods
- **Drift Detector**: Integrated for adherence scoring
- **Project Manager**: Used for project enumeration
- **Flask Application**: RESTful API endpoints

## üîí Security & Performance

### Security Features
- Same authentication as existing sacred endpoints
- Read-only access with no sensitive data exposure
- Input validation and sanitisation
- Comprehensive error logging

### Performance Optimisations
- **Caching**: 5-minute result caching
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations
- **Pagination Ready**: Designed for large datasets
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimised database access patterns

### Scaling Considerations
- Background processing capability for large datasets
- Cache management with automatic cleanup
- Horizontal scaling support through stateless design

## üß™ Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for metrics calculations
- Integration tests for sacred layer interaction
- API endpoint testing
- Performance testing with mock data

### Test Script Usage
```bash
cd /Users/sumitm1/contextkeeper-pro-v3/contextkeeper
python3 test_analytics.py
```

## üìã Integration Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Patching
```bash
python3 patch_rag_agent.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Integration
1. Add import to rag_agent.py:
   ```python
   from analytics_integration import add_analytics_endpoints
   ```

2. Add endpoint integration in `_setup_routes()`:
   ```python
   # Add Sacred Analytics endpoints
   add_analytics_endpoints(self.app, self.agent)
   ```

### Option 3: Direct Implementation
Copy the endpoint code from `analytics_integration.py` directly into the `_setup_routes()` method in rag_agent.py.

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Analytics Query
```bash
curl http://localhost:5556/analytics/sacred
```

### Filtered Analytics
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5556/analytics/sacred?timeframe=30d&project_filter=my_project"
```

### Project-Specific Analytics
```bash
curl http://localhost:5556/analytics/sacred/project/my_project_id
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5556/analytics/sacred/health
```

## üîÑ Future Enhancements
