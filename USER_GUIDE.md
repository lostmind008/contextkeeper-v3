## üöÄ Core Workflows

### 1. Project Management

#### Creating Your First Project
```bash
# Create a new project
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects create "My Awesome App" /path/to/your/project

# The system will automatically:
# - Filter out irrelevant files (venv, node_modules, etc.)
# - Index your codebase for semantic search
# - Set up isolated project context
```

#### Managing Projects
```bash
# List all projects
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects list

# Focus on a specific project
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects focus proj_abc123

# Pause a project (temporarily stop tracking)
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects pause proj_abc123

# Resume a project
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects resume proj_abc123

# Archive a project (long-term storage)
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects archive proj_abc123
```

### 2. Asking Questions with LLM

#### Natural Language Queries
```bash
# Ask about your codebase
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "What authentication system are we using?"

# Get architectural insights
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "How is the database structured?"

# Understand specific features
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "How does the user registration work?"
```

#### What You'll Get
- **Natural Language Responses**: Instead of raw code chunks, you get explanations
- **Context-Aware Answers**: Responses consider your project's architecture
- **Relevant Examples**: Code snippets that actually apply to your project
- **Architectural Insights**: Understanding of how different parts connect

### 3. Decision Tracking

#### Recording Architectural Decisions
```bash
# Add a decision with reasoning
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh decisions add "Using Redis for caching" "Performance reasons" "performance,caching"

# Interactive mode (if no arguments provided)
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh decisions add
# Then follow the prompts
```

#### Why Track Decisions?
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Never lose important architectural reasoning
- **Team Alignment**: Share context with new team members
- **Future Reference**: Understand why certain choices were made
- **AI Context**: Help AI assistants understand your architectural decisions

### 4. Objective Management

#### Setting Development Objectives
```bash
# Add an objective
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh objectives add proj_abc123 "Implement user authentication" "Add JWT-based auth" high

# List objectives
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh objectives list proj_abc123

# Complete an objective
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh objectives complete proj_abc123 obj_123
```

#### Objective Benefits
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development milestones
- **Team Coordination**: Align team efforts
- **AI Assistance**: Help AI understand your current priorities
- **Project Health**: Visual indicators of project progress

### 5. Sacred Plan Management

#### Creating Architectural Plans
```bash
# Create a sacred plan
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred create proj_abc123 "Database Architecture" database_plan.md

# The system will:
# - Generate a verification code
# - Store the plan securely
# - Make it available for drift detection
```

#### Approving Sacred Plans
```bash
# Approve a plan (2-layer verification)
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred approve plan_def456

# This requires:
# 1. Verification code (from plan creation)
# 2. Sacred approval key (from environment)
# 3. Approver name (for audit trail)
```

#### Checking Alignment
```bash
# Check if code aligns with sacred plans
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred drift proj_abc123

# Query sacred context
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred query proj_abc123 "authentication approach"
```

# Check server is running
curl http://localhost:5556/health

# Use correct script name
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects list  # Not rag_cli.sh
```

#### API Key Issues
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $GOOGLE_API_KEY
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY

# Test API access
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
  https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models
