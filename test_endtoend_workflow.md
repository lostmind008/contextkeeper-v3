# End-to-End Workflow Validation

This document validates the complete ContextKeeper v3 user workflow after infrastructure fixes.

## Test Project: E2E Validation

### Project Overview
This is a comprehensive end-to-end test to validate that all ContextKeeper v3 components work together:

1. **RAG System**: File ingestion, embedding, and querying
2. **Sacred Layer**: Plan creation, approval, and context queries  
3. **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface functionality
4. **API Endpoints**: REST API responses and error handling

### Key Components to Test
- Path filtering (no venv/site-packages)
- Latest Google GenAI models (gemini-embedding-001, gemini-2.5-flash)
- Flask async endpoint functionality
- CLI port connectivity (5556)
- Sacred Layer two-layer verification

### Expected Workflow
1. Ingest project files into RAG system
2. Create Sacred plans from requirements
3. Approve plans with verification
4. Query both RAG and Sacred context
5. Validate system integrity

This test confirms all infrastructure fixes work in production scenarios.
