# Documentation Audit Results - ContextKeeper v3

**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Auditor**: Claude Code  
**Scope**: Complete documentation review and accuracy verification

## Executive Summary

Successfully audited and corrected major documentation inconsistencies in ContextKeeper v3. The primary issue was **port confusion** throughout all documentation files, with mixed references to ports 5555 and 5556. Service is confirmed running on port 5556.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Port Number Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Mixed port references causing user confusion  
**Impact**: Users unable to connect to service using documented examples  

**Files Updated**:
- ‚úÖ `API_REFERENCE.md`: Base URL corrected from 5555 ‚Üí 5556, all examples updated
- ‚úÖ `README.md`: All API endpoint examples corrected to port 5556  
- ‚úÖ `CLAUDE.md`: Query examples updated to use correct port
- ‚úÖ `SETUP.md`: Health check command corrected

**Before**: Mixed references to both ports 5555 and 5556  
**After**: Consistent use of port 5556 throughout all documentation

### üü° MEDIUM: Service Status Accuracy
**Problem**: Documentation implied all functionality fully working  
**Impact**: Users may encounter database connectivity issues without context  

**Improvements Made**:
- Added "Currently Working" vs "Known Issues" sections to CLAUDE.md
- Updated SETUP.md with realistic testing procedures
- Added transparency about database setup requirements
- Clarified which endpoints are confirmed working

### üü¢ LOW: Quick Start Improvements
**Problem**: Some quick start commands assumed full functionality  
**Impact**: New users may get errors following setup guides  

**Improvements Made**:
- Updated quick start to focus on confirmed working endpoints
- Added health check verification steps
- Improved troubleshooting guidance

## Current Working Status (Verified)

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working
- **Service**: Running on http://localhost:5556
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` returns `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}`
- **Projects API**: `GET /projects` returns valid project data
- **MCP Integration**: Server configuration correct, connects to Claude Code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Setup/Investigation
- **Query Endpoints**: Database connectivity issues (ChromaDB)
- **CLI Scripts**: Syntax errors in rag_cli_v2.sh
- **Python Dependencies**: Missing chromadb module for direct script usage

## Files Modified

1. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Corrected all port references and examples
2. **README.md** - Updated API documentation and integration examples
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Fixed quick start commands and added status clarity
4. **SETUP.md** - Improved verification procedures and troubleshooting

## Recommendations for Users

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with health checks**: Use `curl http://localhost:5556/health` to verify service
2. **Focus on working endpoints**: /health and /projects are confirmed functional
3. **Check MCP integration**: Verify contextkeeper-sacred tools appear in Claude Code

### For Full Functionality
1. **Database Setup**: May need to configure ChromaDB properly
2. **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages if using CLI directly
3. **Environment Variables**: Set SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY if using sacred features

## Quality Assurance

All documentation now uses:
- ‚úÖ Australian English spelling consistently
- ‚úÖ Correct port number (5556) throughout
- ‚úÖ Factual language without promotional claims
- ‚úÖ Clear distinction between working and experimental features
- ‚úÖ Accurate working code examples and commands

## Impact Assessment

**HIGH POSITIVE IMPACT**: Users can now successfully connect to the service using documented examples. Documentation accurately reflects the working system state, preventing confusion and failed setup attempts.

**RISK MITIGATION**: Added transparency about known issues prevents users from assuming problems are on their end when encountering expected database setup requirements.
