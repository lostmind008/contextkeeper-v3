Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with ChromaDB vector search and Google Gemini, it maintains intelligent context across your projects, tracks architectural decisions, and provides real-time development insights.

> **🚧 CURRENT STATUS (August 2025)**: v3.0 - **Local Development Ready**  
> ✅ Core RAG functionality working • ✅ Real-time dashboard • ⚠️ No authentication (local use only) • ⚠️ Some async issues in Sacred Layer

## 🎯 When to Use ContextKeeper

**Perfect for:**
- **Microservices teams** managing 5+ related repositories
- **Legacy codebase exploration** where documentation is scattered or outdated
- **Team onboarding** to complex systems with multiple interconnected components
- **Architectural decision tracking** across long-term projects
- **Context preservation** during developer handoffs or team transitions

**Not suitable for:**
- Single, well-documented repositories under 10,000 lines
- Real-time pair programming or live collaboration
- Production environments requiring authentication
- Highly sensitive codebases (no access control implemented)

## 💪 Current Capabilities

### ✅ **Proven Working Features**
- **📚 Multi-Project RAG**: Query multiple codebases with intelligent context isolation
- **🎨 Real-Time Dashboard**: WebSocket-powered UI showing live project status at `localhost:5556`
- **🤖 Natural Language Queries**: "How does authentication work in the payment service?"
- **⚡ Vector Search**: ChromaDB-powered semantic code search across your entire codebase
- **🏗️ Project Isolation**: Zero cross-contamination between different codebases
- **📊 Development Analytics**: Track coding patterns, file changes, and project health
- **🔒 Data Security**: Automatic API key redaction and secure local storage

### ⚠️ **Limitations & Known Issues** 
- **No Authentication**: Local use only - anyone with network access can query your code
- **Scale Unknown**: Not performance-tested beyond small-to-medium projects (< 100MB)
- **Sacred Layer Bugs**: Some async issues in architectural decision management (72% test pass rate)
- **API Costs**: Large codebases may incur significant Google Gemini API charges
- **Manual Project Setup**: Each codebase requires explicit indexing before use

## 🚀 Real-World SWE Scenario

**The Problem**: Your team inherited a microservices architecture with 8 repositories, inconsistent documentation, and no one remembers why certain design decisions were made.

**The Solution**: ContextKeeper indexes all repos and maintains queryable context:

```bash
# Setup (5 minutes)
git clone https://github.com/lostmind008/contextkeeper-pro-v3.git
cd contextkeeper-pro-v3/contextkeeper
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env: Add GEMINI_API_KEY and create SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY

# Start the system
python rag_agent.py server
# Dashboard now running at http://localhost:5556/analytics_dashboard_live.html

# Index your services (30 seconds each)
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh project add "/path/to/user-service" "User Service"
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh project add "/path/to/payment-service" "Payment Service" 
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh project add "/path/to/order-service" "Order Service"
# Watch real-time indexing progress in dashboard

# Start querying across all codebases
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh query "How do microservices communicate with each other?"
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh query "Where is user authentication implemented?"
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh query "What database schema changes happened in the last month?"
```

**Expected Results**:
- Semantic search finds relevant code across all 8 repositories
- Natural language answers with file references and code snippets
- Real-time dashboard shows project health and development activity
- Architectural decisions preserved in Sacred Layer (when working properly)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Security Status
✅ **Security vulnerabilities patched** (OWASP Top 10 fixes applied)  
✅ **Input validation implemented** for all user inputs  
✅ **API key redaction working** - secrets automatically cleaned from logs  
✅ **Path traversal protection** - file access properly sandboxed  
❌ **No authentication system** - anyone with network access can query  
❌ **No authorisation controls** - all users have full access  
❌ **No audit logging** - user actions not tracked  

### Recommended Usage Patterns
- **Local development only** - do not expose to public networks
- **Trusted team members** - assume anyone on network has full access
- **Non-sensitive codebases** - avoid using with proprietary or secret code
- **Regular API key rotation** - monitor Gemini API usage and costs

### Network Security
```bash
# Bind to localhost only (default)
CONTEXTKEEPER_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Never use 0.0.0.0 in production

# Use firewall to restrict access if needed
# Only allow specific IPs to connect to port 5556
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port 5556 is in use
lsof -i :5556

# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>

# Start with different port
CONTEXTKEEPER_PORT=5557 python rag_agent.py server
```

**Project indexing fails**
```bash
# Check disk space (ChromaDB needs storage)
df -h

# Check API key is valid
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
     https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models

# Clear ChromaDB and retry
rm -rf ./rag_knowledge_db/
./scripts/contextkeeper.sh project add "/path/to/code" "Project Name"
```

**Dashboard not loading**
```bash
# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5556/health

# Check browser console for WebSocket errors
# Open developer tools → Console

# Try different browser (WebSocket compatibility)
```

**High API costs**
```bash
# Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console
# Set billing alerts to avoid surprises

# Reduce embedding frequency for large projects
# Focus on specific directories instead of entire codebase
```

**Sacred Layer errors**
```bash
# Sacred Layer has known async issues - expected behavior
# Core RAG functionality still works fine

# Check test results for current status
pytest tests/sacred/ -v
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check test results**: `pytest tests/ -v` shows current functionality status
2. **Review logs**: Server logs show detailed error information  
3. **Dashboard health check**: `curl http://localhost:5556/health`
4. **API key validation**: Ensure Gemini API key has proper permissions
5. **File an issue**: Include test results and error logs
