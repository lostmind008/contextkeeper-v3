**ContextKeeper** is an enhanced AI agent that maintains persistent knowledge across multiple projects and coding sessions using vector search, intelligent code indexing, and comprehensive project management.

## 🌟 What's New in v3.0?

ContextKeeper v3.0 introduces the **Sacred Layer**, a groundbreaking feature that ensures AI agents adhere to approved architectural plans.

- **Sacred Layer**: Create immutable architectural plans with a 2-layer verification process. This ensures that the core architecture of your project is protected from unintended changes by AI agents.
- **Git-Based Tracking**: ContextKeeper now uses Git to track file changes, providing a more robust and reliable way to keep the knowledge base up-to-date.
- **Drift Detection**: The agent can now detect when the codebase has drifted from the sacred plan, providing warnings and suggestions for realignment.
- **Enhanced MCP Integration**: The MCP server now exposes tools for interacting with the Sacred Layer, allowing AI assistants like Claude to be aware of and respect the sacred plans.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: A new dashboard provides a visual overview of project health, including sacred plan adherence and recent activity.

### Core Features
- **Multi-Project Management**: Track multiple projects simultaneously with independent configurations.
- **Decision & Objective Tracking**: Record architectural decisions and track development objectives.
- **Context Export**: Generate rich context for AI assistants.
- **Semantic Search**: Search your entire codebase using natural language.
- **Security**: Automatically redacts API keys and sensitive data.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lostmind008/contextkeeper.git
cd contextkeeper
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file with your Google Cloud credentials:
```bash
# Google Cloud Configuration
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your-service-account.json
```

### 3. Start the Agent

No manual configuration needed! With v3.0, you can dynamically add projects:
```bash
# Start the agent
./rag_cli.sh start

# Create your first project
./rag_cli.sh projects create "My Project" /path/to/project

# The agent will automatically watch the project directories
```


## Usage Examples

### Query the knowledge base:
```bash
./rag_cli.sh ask "What authentication system did I use?"
```

### Add a decision:
```bash
./rag_cli.sh add "Using CrewAI for multi-agent system"
```

### Get morning briefing:
```bash
./rag_cli.sh morning
```

## 📡 API Documentation

### Query Endpoint
```bash
POST http://localhost:5556/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "What authentication system are we using?",
  "k": 5  # Number of results (optional, default: 10)
}
```

### Add Decision Endpoint
```bash
POST http://localhost:5556/decision
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "decision": "Using Redis for caching",
  "context": "Need fast session storage",
  "importance": "high"
}
```

### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:5556/health
```

## Troubleshooting

If the agent doesn't start:
1. Check your Google Cloud credentials in `.env`
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
3. Check logs: `tail -f rag_agent.log`

## Integration with Claude

Add to your Claude Custom Instructions:
```
When context is near limit, query http://localhost:5556/query for project context.
```

## 🔌 MCP Integration (v3.0)

ContextKeeper now includes a powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates directly with Claude Code, providing real-time development context and sacred plan protection.

### Quick Setup

1. **Add to Claude Code MCP Configuration**:
   ```json
   "contextkeeper-sacred": {
     "type": "stdio",
     "command": "node",
     "args": [
       "/Users/sumitm1/Documents/myproject/Ongoing Projects/ContextKeeper Pro/ContextKeeper v3 Upgrade/contextkeeper/mcp-server/enhanced_mcp_server.js"
     ],
     "env": {
       "RAG_AGENT_URL": "http://localhost:5556"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Start ContextKeeper with Sacred Layer**:
   ```bash
   cd contextkeeper
   source venv/bin/activate
   python rag_agent.py start
   ```

### Available MCP Tools

The ContextKeeper MCP server provides 8 sacred-aware tools:

- **🔍 get_sacred_context** - Retrieve sacred architectural plans
- **⚠️ check_sacred_drift** - Real-time violation detection  
- **💬 query_with_llm** - Natural language responses from knowledge base
- **📋 export_development_context** - Complete project context
- **📊 get_development_context** - Comprehensive project status
- **🔎 intelligent_search** - Semantic search across plans and code
- **📝 create_sacred_plan** - Sacred plan creation workflow
- **❤️ health_check** - System status verification

### Benefits

- **AI Safety**: Sacred plans prevent AI agent derailment
- **Context Preservation**: Rich development context via MCP
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Drift detection operational
- **Natural Language**: Conversational explanations of technical decisions
- **Violation Prevention**: Sacred plan compliance enforced

## Next Steps

1. Update the `watch_dirs` in `rag_agent.py` to point to your actual project directories
2. Add the contextkeeper directory to your PATH for easy access
3. Consider setting up as a system service for automatic startup
