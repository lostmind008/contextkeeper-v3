# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

## üéØ CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATE
**Project**: ContextKeeper v3.0
**Branch**: main
**Status**: ‚úÖ v3.0 Upgrade Complete with Chat Interface
**Priority**: UI Enhancement & Documentation
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04 (Added chat interface, fixed Create Project, added LOGBOOK.md)

## üöÄ QUICK START (Get Running in 2 Minutes)
```bash
# 1. Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Start the agent (use 'server' to avoid segmentation fault)
python rag_agent.py server

# 3. Test working endpoints  
curl http://localhost:5556/health       # Should return {"status":"healthy"}
curl http://localhost:5556/projects     # Should return projects data
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects list   # CLI interface

# 4. Access the dashboard with chat interface
open http://localhost:5556/analytics_dashboard_live.html

# 5. Check MCP server is connected (optional)
# Verify in Claude Code that contextkeeper-sacred tools are available
```

## üÜï CRITICAL: Development Logging
**ALWAYS update LOGBOOK.md after making changes!**
```bash
# Use time MCP for accurate timestamps:
mcp__time__get_current_time --timezone "Australia/Sydney"

# Add entry to LOGBOOK.md with format:
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AEST] - [Component] - [Action] - [Details]
```

## üéØ ESSENTIAL WORKFLOW: Creating & Tracking New Projects

**CRITICAL**: Always follow this exact sequence when adding a new project:

```bash
# 1. Create the project with its path
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects create <project_name> <project_path>
# Example: ./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects create veo3app /Users/sumitm1/Documents/myproject/veo3-video-application

# 2. Focus on the project (make it active)
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh projects focus <project_id>
# The project_id is returned from step 1 (e.g., proj_736df3fd80a4)

# 3. Index the project files (ESSENTIAL - often missed!)
python rag_agent.py ingest --path <project_path>
# This will process all files and may take 2-3 minutes for large projects

# 4. Verify it's working
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "How does this project work?" --project <project_id>
# OR use the API:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query_llm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Explain the project architecture", "k": 5, "project_id": "<project_id>"}'
```

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå Forgetting to index files after project creation
- ‚ùå Using old CLI (rag_cli.sh) instead of v2 (rag_cli_v2.sh)
- ‚ùå Not focusing on a project before querying
- ‚ùå Expecting immediate results without indexing

## üåü CURRENT FEATURES (August 2025)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Chat Interface** - Beautiful glass morphism UI in dashboard
   - Send queries directly from the dashboard
   - Chat history with localStorage persistence
   - Quick action buttons for common queries
   - Markdown rendering for code blocks

2. **Create Project** (Fixed 2025-08-04)
   - Now asks for both name AND path
   - Actually creates projects (API call was broken)
   - Shows proper error messages
   - Dashboard refreshes after creation

3. **Event Tracking** - Real-time development intelligence
   - Track errors, deployments, decisions
   - Query recent events via API
   - Severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Enhancement
1. **Create Project Modal**
   - Currently uses text input for path (needs file browser)
   - No automatic indexing after creation
   - Must manually run indexing command

2. **Project Status**
   - No visual indicators for indexed vs not indexed
   - Can't re-index from UI
   - No progress tracking during indexing

3. **Chat Responses**
   - Poor quality if project not properly indexed
   - Need meaningful content in knowledge base
   - Base64/binary files provide no searchable context

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

### Code Style (Follow User's Preferences)
```python
# Use Australian English spelling
colour = "blue"  # not color
behaviour = "expected"  # not behavior

# Conversational comments (user's signature style)
# alright, so the idea here is to...
# basically, we need to do this because...
# fair warning - this might seem unconventional, but...
```

### Architecture Patterns to Follow
- **Sacred Layer**: Immutable storage, 2-layer verification, isolated ChromaDB
- **Project Isolation**: Each project gets own ChromaDB collection
- **Git Integration**: Track commits, not file changes
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Sacred plans act as guardrails for AI agents

### Testing Approach
```bash
# Always test after changes
pytest tests/sacred -v          # Sacred layer
pytest tests/git -v             # Git integration  
pytest tests/drift -v           # Drift detection
python test_multiproject.py     # End-to-end
```

## üìÅ FILE NAVIGATION MAP

**Core Sacred Files** (what you'll work with most):
```
rag_agent.py                 # Main orchestrator - ADD sacred integration here
sacred_layer_implementation.py  # Sacred core - USE as-is
git_activity_tracker.py     # Git tracking - USE as-is
enhanced_drift_sacred.py    # Drift detection - USE as-is
sacred_cli_integration.sh   # CLI commands - SOURCE this
```

**Reference Implementations** (approved patterns):
```
v3 Approved Plan for AI Agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sacred_layer_implementation.py    # Reference if needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enhanced_mcp_server.js           # MCP server for later
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics_dashboard.html         # Dashboard for later
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ revised_implementation_roadmap.md # Complete vision
```

## ‚ö° COMMON WORKFLOWS

### Sacred Plan Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create a sacred plan
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred create proj_123 "API Authentication" api_auth_plan.md

# 2. Approve the plan with 2-layer verification
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred approve plan_abc123

# 3. Check for drift
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh sacred drift proj_123
```

### Querying the Knowledge Base
```bash
# Ask a question via CLI
./scripts/rag_cli_v2.sh ask "What is the approved method for API authentication?"

# Test natural language responses via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query_llm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the sacred layer?", "k": 5}'

# Compare with raw query  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the sacred layer?", "k": 5}'
```

### LLM-Enhanced Query
```bash
# Get a natural language response
curl -X POST http://localhost:5556/query_llm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Explain the sacred layer.", "k": 5}'
```

## üéØ MCP Server Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools for AI assistants:

- **`get_sacred_context`**: Get approved sacred plans for a project.
- **`check_sacred_drift`**: Check if current development aligns with sacred plans.
- **`query_with_llm`**: Query the knowledge base with natural language responses.
- **`export_development_context`**: Export complete development context including sacred plans.
- **`get_development_context`**: Get comprehensive development context including project status, git activity, objectives, decisions, and sacred layer analysis.
- **`intelligent_search`**: Search with semantic understanding across code, decisions, objectives, and sacred plans.
- **`create_sacred_plan`**: Create a new sacred architectural plan.
- **`health_check`**: Check the health status of the sacred layer and RAG agent.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ENVIRONMENT CHECK

Required for sacred layer:
```bash
# Check these exist
echo $SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY        # Should be set
ls sacred_layer_implementation.py # Should exist
ls tests/sacred/                 # Should exist
./upgrade_to_v3_sacred.sh --check # Should pass
```

## üìù DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

### Critical Learning: Avoid Misleading Legacy Documentation
**Issue Discovered**: Comments and documentation left behind during development can mislead future readers who might assume outdated status represents current state rather than checking latest enhancements.

**Mandatory Practice for AI Coding Agents:**
1. **Clean Up As You Go**: Remove outdated comments, TODOs, and status indicators immediately when completing work
2. **Update Status Consistently**: Ensure all documentation files reflect current implementation state
3. **Remove Placeholder Content**: Delete template comments, example code, and "TODO" markers when functionality is complete
4. **Verify Cross-References**: Check that all file references, command examples, and technical details match actual implementation
5. **Document Completion**: Mark phases/tasks as complete in ALL relevant files, not just primary documentation

**Example**: After completing Phase 3, ALL files should show "Phase 3 COMPLETE" status, not mixed states like "Phase 1 Ready" in some files and "Phase 3 Complete" in others.

**Why This Matters**: Future developers (including AI agents) rely on documentation accuracy. Inconsistent or outdated documentation creates confusion and can lead to incorrect assumptions about project state.
